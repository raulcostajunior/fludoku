## 1.0.0

- Initial version with full capabilities (generator lib completed)

   **Know issue**: to avoid long generation times (several minutes) the number of maximum empty positions on generated puzzles is artificially limited to 81. In practice, this affects only boards with dimensions 16 or 25.

## 0.6.0

- Initial version (without Board generation capability)
